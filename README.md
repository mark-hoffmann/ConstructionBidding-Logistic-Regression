# Construction Bidding -- Logistic Example

This is an example in SAS showing a simple model building approach to predicting whether a firm would win a particular bid.
The technique used was exclusively Logistic Regression, but also performed PCA to cluster similar competitor behaviours with one another.

An RShiny app was then prototyped to visualize some of the data as well as act as an interface for simple input / output.
